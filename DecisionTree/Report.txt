REPORT:

DATASETS USED:
	1. IRIS
	2. BREAST CANCER
	3. CAR VALUATION
	
TRAIN TEST SPLIT:

Train test split value is changed to 0.3 i.e. 30% of the dataset is taken as dataset for testing and 70% is used for training the model.
This ratio is as per 70/30 rule in machine learning and is considered a best practice.

	
PRUNING:
We implemented 3 pruning strategies.

# STRATEGY 1: RANDOMLY PICK N NODES AND PRUNE THEM

	Description: We pick n nodes (where value of n ranges from 4 to 30) using random fucntion in python and prune these nodes. The upper limit is taken as 30 and lower limit is taken as 4 (this is because the accuracy after pruning 4 nodes starts to increase as compared to accuracy of tree before pruning)

# STRATEGY 2: PRUNE ALL NODES THAT ARE ONE LEVEL ABOVE LEAF

	Description: For all the nodes in list of inner nodes, we calculate its children ID (children ID  are 2 * parentID + 1 and 2 * parentID + 2). We further check if these IDs are present in list of Leaf nodes and prune the parent node if they are present.

# STRATEGY 3: PRUNE ALL NODES AT A CERTAIN DEPTH

	Description: We calculate the maximum depth of all the inner nodes and prune all nodes present at this depth.


OUTPUT:

IRIS DATASET : 		ACCURACY BEFORE PRUNING:	0.97
					ACCURACY AFTER PRUNING USING STRATEGY 1 :	0.93
					ACCURACY AFTER PRUNING USING STRATEGY 2 :	0.93
					ACCURACY AFTER PRUNING USING STRATEGY 3 :	0.93
					
Accuracy after pruning is less than accuracy before pruning. This could possibly be because we have arrived at the best case of decision tree before pruning. In such case, pruning a tree might result in decrease in accuracy.
					
BREAST CANCER DATASET : 		ACCURACY BEFORE PRUNING:	0.74
								ACCURACY AFTER PRUNING USING STRATEGY 1 :	0.79
								ACCURACY AFTER PRUNING USING STRATEGY 2 :	0.79
								ACCURACY AFTER PRUNING USING STRATEGY 3 :	0.79
					
CAR VALUATION DATASET : 		ACCURACY BEFORE PRUNING:	0.76
								ACCURACY AFTER PRUNING USING STRATEGY 1 :	0.84
								ACCURACY AFTER PRUNING USING STRATEGY 2 :	0.84
								ACCURACY AFTER PRUNING USING STRATEGY 3 :	0.84
